/**
 * The MySensors Arduino library handles the wireless radio link and protocol
 * between your home built sensors/actuators and HA controller of choice.
 * The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
 * repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
 * network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.

 /******************************************************************* 
 * EDIT: June 03, 2017
 * DESCRIPTION 
 * As part of an one-year project at Herman Hollerith Zentrum (HHZ),
 * an IoT environment was set up. The original script was modified 
 * to integrate the sensor into our IoT environment.
 * 
 * ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 * -  Used sensor: HC-SR501 (motion sensor)
 * -  Modified by manh3141
